Type `{{presentation}}` or `{{slides}}` in a block. Clicking the button will overlay a presentation directly from Roam! Exit the presentation by hitting 'ESC'.

To specify what content is part of the presentation, create a child block for each slide. Each child block would in turn render its children as the slide contents. For example, the Playground presentation below uses the following structure:

- {{presentation}}
    - 1
        - \# First Slide
    - 2
        - \# Second Slide
        - \#\#\# With a Subtitle on what we're all about
    - 3
        - \# Third Slide
        - First bullet with a point
        - Second Bullet supporting that point
        - Third bullet sealing the deal
    - 4
        - \# Final Slide
