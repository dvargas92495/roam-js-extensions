Type `{{presentation}}` or `{{slides}}` in a block. Clicking the button will overlay a presentation directly from Roam! Exit the presentation by hitting 'ESC'.

To specify what content is part of the presentation, create a child block for each slide. The text of each child will serve as the slide title. Each child block then in turn renders its children as the slide contents in a bulleted outline. For example, the Playground presentation below uses the following structure:

- {{presentation}}
    - First Slide
    - Second Slide
        - With a Subtitle on what we're all about
    - Third Slide
        - First bullet with a point
        - Second Bullet supporting that point
            - With a nested point!
        - Third bullet sealing the deal
    - Final Slide

Any blocks with images will be rendered without a bullet.

There are 11 themes supported, which could be found [here](https://revealjs.com/themes/). To use one, add a `:{theme:[value]}` to the presentation button. For example, the demo below uses the black theme:

- `{{presentation:{theme:black}}}`

Apart from these themes, you could also use `roam/css` to style the presentation. Here are some classes to keep in mind:
- `reveal-viewport` - The full presentation container
- `slides` - The slide container
- `present` - The current slide
- `slide-background` - The slide background
- `navigate-left` - The go left button
- `navigate-right` - The go right button
