Type `{{alert}}` into a block. A popover will appear with "When" and "Message" fields. Enter when you want the alert to trigger in natural language like "In 5 minutes" or "In 2 hours" in the "When" field. Enter what message you want the alert to say in the "Message" field. After the specified amount of time, an alert will appear in Roam with the message you specified!
