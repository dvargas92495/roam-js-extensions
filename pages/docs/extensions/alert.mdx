Type `{{alert}}` into a block. A popover will appear with "When" and "Message" fields. Enter when you want the alert to trigger in natural language like "In 5 minutes" or "In 2 hours" in the "When" field. Enter what message you want the alert to say in the "Message" field. After the specified amount of time, an alert will appear in Roam with the message you specified!

Additionally, the popover has an "Allow Notification" checkbox. When checked, the alert will instead use a notification for the alert instead of the standard browser alert. You will need to enable browser notifications from Roam to use this.

The Alert used is Blueprint's [Alert component](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/#core/components/alert). Additionally, there is a `roamjs-window-alert` class name on the component to allow for custom styling in your Roam themes.

At any time, you could hit the `ALT+SHIFT+A` keyboard shortcut to view the Alerts Dashboard. Here, you'll see a list of all of your live extensions. Clicking the trash icon will remove the alert.
