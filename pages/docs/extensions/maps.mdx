import DemoMaps from "../../../components/DemoMaps";

This script is not configurable

Type `{{maps}}` in a block. When the block renders, an interactive map will render in its place!

To position the map at a particular center, create a child block with text "Center". Under that block, put in the latitude and longitude coordinates of the center delimited by a comma.

### Playground
