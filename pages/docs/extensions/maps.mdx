import DemoMaps from "../../../components/DemoMaps";

This script is not configurable

Type `{{maps}}` in a block. When the block renders, an interactive map will render in its place!

To position the map at a particular center, create a child block with text "Center". Under that block, put in the latitude and longitude coordinates of the center delimited by a comma.

To start the map at a particular zoom level, create a child block with text "Zoom". Under that block, put in the zoom level value which should be a number.

To add Markers to the map, create a child block with text "Markers". Under that block, add one child for every marker you want to include. The format of each child block should be:
```
text, latitude, longitude
```

Where text is the label that will appear on the marker, latitude is a decimal value for the latitude, and longitude is a decimal value for the longitude.
