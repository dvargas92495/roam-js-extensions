Type {{calculate:}} into a block. Everything to the right of the colon will be the expression to be calculated.

An expression could be one of four options:
- A number
- A tag
- A binary operation
- A function

Numbers and tags are what you would expect. A binary operation combines two expressions with one of these four operations:
- +
- -
- *
- /

A function is a higher level macro that take one or more expressions as input and produces an output. The syntax of each function is `{name:(expression)+}`. The supported functions are:
- attr - takes two tag names as input, returning the value assigned to the attribute with the second name on the page with the first name.
    - `{attr: [[Example Project]] [[Due Date]]}` returns the value assigned to the `Due Date` attribute on the `Example Project` page.
- daily - takes one or more tags as input, and returns all the daily note pages that reference those tags in the same block
    - 
- max
- since
