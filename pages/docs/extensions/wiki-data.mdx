import { DemoWikiData } from "../../../src/components/WikiData";

The script is not configurable.

In a block, type `{{wiki}}`. Similar to date picker, there will be an overlay that appears next to the wiki button. There will be a search input and button that could be used to query wikipedia for the desired page. Up to 10 search results will be returned. Upon clicking or hitting enter on one of the results, the intro for the wikipedia page will be entered into the block!

### Playground

Play with the button below to get a sense of how the Wiki Data integration works! Saved queries will get outputted to the neighboring textbox.
