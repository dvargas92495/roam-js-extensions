description: 'The Google Calendar to Roam Integration allows users to import the list of events on a given day into their daily notes page.'

The script supports the following configuration attributes, to be added in the `[[roam/js/google-calendar]]` page:

- `Google Calendar` - (Required) This is the calendar ID that the extension will use to query for events. It's usually your gmail address, such as `dvargas92495@gmail.com`.
- `Include Event Link` - (Optional) Set to `true` if you would like to hyperlink the event summary with a link to the google calendar event. Note, because there are more characters to be typed it's a slower operation.
- `Skip Free` - (Optional) Set to `true` if you would like to filter out the events from your calendar that you've set to 'Free'
- `Format` - (Optional) The text to add for each calendar event. Could use the following placeholders to be replaced with the event's data:
    - `/Summary` - the name of the event 
    - `/Link` - the link for the event
    - `/Hangout` - the hangout link for the event
    - `/Location` - the location for the event
    - `/Start Time` - the start time of the event - `/End Time` - the end time of the event

Here's an example configuration page:

Be sure to make your calendar publicly accessible, since it needs to be queryable by the extension's api token:

In any page, create a `Import Google Calendar` button by typing in `{{import google calendar}}` (case-insensitive) in a block. Upon clicking the button, the extension will clear the button and fill the page in with the events you have scheduled for that day in the following format by default:

> [Summary] ([Start Time (hh:mm am)] - [End Time (hh:mm pm)]) [ - link to Zoom/Meet]

It will be displayed in the timezone of your browser. It will use either the page's title if it's a daily note, or the current date if it's not.

This extension is also integrated with [Smart Blocks](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/roamhacker/page/GH0401tnt)! If you have both this extension and Roam42 installed, there will be a `<%GOOGLECALENDAR%>` command available. The command will automatically run the import google calendar logic and paste the events in blocks before continuing with the rest of the workflow.
