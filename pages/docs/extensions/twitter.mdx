The script supports the following configuration attributes, to be added in the `[[roam/js/twitter]]` page:

- `Username` - (Required) This is your twitter handle.

Here's an example configuration page:

![](/images/twitter-config.png)

In any page, create a `Twitter References` button by typing in `{{twitter references}}` (case-insensitive) in a block. Upon clicking the button, the extension will clear the button and fill the page in with the tweets where you've mentioned that page title. So, if you've tweeted about `books` a lot on twitter, you can head over to the `books` page on roam, and then pull all your tweets about `books`!

One caveat is that this can only pull tweets made in the last 7 days.
