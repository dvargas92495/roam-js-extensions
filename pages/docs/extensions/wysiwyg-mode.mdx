import {DemoWYSIWYGMode} from "../../../src/components/WYSIWYGMode";

To edit a block in WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) mode, hold on the **ALT** key while clicking on it. Now you should be able to edit the content just like how it will be when rendered!

While in a block, you could hit **ALT+w** to toggle the block to and from WYSIWYG mode. 

### Playground

The text area below is meant to act as a Roam block. Hit **ALT+w** to toggle to and from WYSIWYG Mode.

<DemoWYSIWYGMode />
