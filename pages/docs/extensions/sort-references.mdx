description: 'The Sort Linked References extension adds an icon button to the user page that could be used to sort linked references.'

The script supports the following configuration attributes, to be added in the `[[roam/js/sort-references]]` page:

- `Default Sort` - (Optional) The default mode used to sort references on all pages. Valid values include all the options below, written without the 'Sort By' prefix. For example, `Default Sort:: Page Title`.

Near the linked references, there will appear a sort icon next to the filter icon. Clicking on the sort icon will make a sort menu visible to the user with the following options:

- Sort By Page Title - This will sort all the linked references in ascending alphabetical order of the page title.
- Sort By Page Title Descending - This will sort all the linked references in descending alphabetical order of the page title.
- Sort By Created Date - This will sort all the linked references in ascending order that the page was created.
- Sort By Created Date Descending - This will sort all the linked references in descending order that the page was created.
- Sort By Daily Note - This will sort all the linked references in ascending order by Daily Note, followed by created date of non-daily note pages.
- Sort By Daily Note Descending - This will sort all the linked references in descending order by Daily Note, followed by created date of non-daily note pages.

You could also add a `Default Sort` attribute with a valid value on the page itself to have a specific sorting for just that page.
