description: 'The Tag Cycle Extension allows users to define custom cycles tied to a keyboard shortcut!'

This script is configured in the [[roam/js/tag-cycle]] page.

For every cycle you want, make a block denoting the keyboard shortcut that will trigger that cycle. Then as children of that block, create one block for each text in the cycle.

Now when you're in a given block, the keyboard shortcut will replace text in your block based on the cycle you defined!

This is what it would look like for Roam's native TODO/DONE cycle:

- CTRL+Enter
    -
    - [[TODO]]
    - [[DONE]]
