description: 'The Tag Cycle Extension allows users to define custom cycles tied to a keyboard shortcut!'
development: true

This script is configured in the [[roam/js/tag-cycle]] page.

For every cycle you want, make a block denoting the keyboard shortcut that will trigger that cycle. Then as children of that block, create one block for each text in the cycle.

Now when you're in a given block, the keyboard shortcut will replace text in your block based on the cycle you defined!

The format of a keyboard shortcut is deliminated by `+`. The following modifiers are supported:
- CTRL
- CMD
- WIN
- ALT
Additionally, could use "SHIFT", but it should added after the modifier. The Key pressed is the last component.

This is what it would look like for Roam's native TODO/DONE cycle:

- CTRL+Enter
    -
    - TODO
    - DONE

Here is what I use for my project tracking:

![](/images/tag-cycle.md)

Note that this means entering an empty block will clear the previous element, and append the next element when no other element is found.

If you change the blocks on the configuration page, you will need to refresh for the changes to take effect.
