import MouselessDialog from "../../../src/components/MouselessDialog";

The script is not configurable.

The biggest hurdle to transitioning to a mouseless experience in any application is remembering what keyboard shortcut maps to what. This extension adds a "master" keyboard short cut in **CTRL+?** on Windows, **CMD+?** on Mac. Once triggered, a help modal will appear where you could start typing your desired action to discover or remind yourself of what the key mapping is. Hit **ESC** to exit the modal back to the previously focused location.

The extension also adds the following shortcuts that were previously unsupported:
- `Ctrl-Shift-S` - Add Shortcut To Page

More shortcuts will be added over time as I find moments where I use my mouse.

There will undoubtedly commands that the dialog will be missing, especially as time goes on. Feel free to ping me if so!

### Playground
