import MouselessDialog from "../../../src/components/MouselessDialog";

The script is not configurable.

The biggest hurdle to transitioning to a mouseless experience in any application is remembering what keyboard shortcut maps to what. This extension adds a "master" keyboard short cut in **CTRL+?** on Windows, **CMD+?** on Mac. Once triggered, a help modal will appear where you could start typing your desired action to discover or remind yourself of what the key mapping is. Hit **ESC** to exit the modal back to the previously focused location.

### Playground

<MouselessDialog />

Hit **CTRL+?** on Windows or **CMD+?** on Mac to render the Mouseless Help Dialog!
