Any page with embeds will now respect page filters. 

To create an embed, type `{{embed:((block-uid))}}` into a block. Note, that this is a native Roam feature.

To use a page filter, click the filter icon on the top right of a page. 

This extension currently only supports REMOVE filters on a page. This is because Roam will filter out the full embed, since it's on a block without the tag.
