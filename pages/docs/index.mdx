# Extensions

These docs explain all of the available extensions, as well as how to set up and use each one.

## Installation

Each tool is hosted at `https://roamjs.com/[name].js`. To use any given tool, add the following code block under a `{{[[roam/js]]}}` block in your Roam database, replacing `[name]` with the actual name of the script:

```js
var old = document.getElementById("[name]");
if (old) {
  old.remove();
}

var s = document.createElement("script");
s.src = "https://roamjs.com/[name].js";
s.id = "[name]";
s.async = false;
s.type = "text/javascript";
document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s);
```

The code block runs on initial load of your roam database. It adds a script tag to the head of your browser, which loads then runs the tool, providing you with the added functionality.

To install multiple scripts in a single code block, add the following code block instead:

```javascript
const addScript = (name) => {
  var old = document.getElementById(name);
  if (old) {
    old.remove();
  }

  var s = document.createElement("script");
  s.src = \`https://roamjs.com/${name}.js\`;
  s.id = name;
  s.async = false;
  s.type = "text/javascript";
  document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s);
};

addScript("[name1]"); // replace with name of extension
addScript("[name2]"); // replace with name of extension
// ...
```

To install **all** the supported extensions, click the button below and paste the output anywhere in your Roam DB!

Each extension will support a `[[roam/js/[name]]]` configuration page in your Roam database. This is where you will be able to configure the extension with various options using attributes.
