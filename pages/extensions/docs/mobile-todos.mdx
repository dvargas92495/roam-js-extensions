description: "The Mobile TODO extension provides user with the `[[TODO]]`/`[[DONE]]` shortcut previously only accessible to keyboard shortcuts."

The script is not configurable.

On a mobile device, focus on a block. Once the keyboard and mobile bar comes up from the bottom, hit the menu icon on the bottom right. This will toggle a new set of buttons, the first of which is a shortcut for TODOs on mobile! Click the icon to toggle between TODO/DONE states!
