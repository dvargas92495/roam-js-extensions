description: 'The Roam Emoji extension allows users to use familiar colon syntax to insert emojis into the text block.'

The script supports the following configuration attributes, to be added in the `[[roam/js/emojis]]` page:

- `Minimum Characters` - (Optional) The minimum number of characters needed to show the emoji menu, defaulted to 2 just like in slack.

In a block, start typing with a colon, the name of the emoji, followed by an ending colon. The script will replace the colon'ed phrase with the supported emoji.

To view all available emojis, they could be found in the following [JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omnidan/node-emoji/master/lib/emoji.json).
