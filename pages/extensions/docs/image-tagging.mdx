description: 'The Image Tagging extension extracts the text from an image and outputs it into Roam!'
---

The script supports the following configuration attributes, to be added in the `[[roam/js/image-tagging]]` page:

- `Trigger` - (Optional) The action to do on an image to extract a text. Valid values include `DOUBLE CLICK`, `SHIFT CLICK`, and `ICON CLICK`. By default, it uses `DOUBLE CLICK`.

Double click on an image in your database. The extension will use an OCR library to extract all the text found in an image. In the meantime, it will insert a "Loading..." text as a child block. Once the extension finishes, it will replace the Loading text with all the new text it parsed from the image.

If the text begins with a bullet or dash on a line, the bullet will be stripped, leaving the rest of the text content.
