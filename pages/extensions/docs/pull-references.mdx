The script supports the following configuration attributes, to be added in the `[[roam/js/pull-references]]` page:

- `Format` - (Optional) The format that each reference will use when added to the page. Use `${ref}` to specify where you want the text to be replaced by the block reference.
- `Remove Tags` - (Optional) Set to 'True' if you would like to remove the tags from the block references after pulling them to the page.

Create a button by typing `{{pull references}}` into a page. Clicking the button adds all the linked references as references on the current page.

### Installation

Insert this as a child of any `{{[[roam/js]]}}` block to install the extension.
