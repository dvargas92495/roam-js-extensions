#### Welcome to RoamJS Services!

RoamJS Services are a collection of Roam-related automations that help you better tap into the power of your Roam graph. Unlike extensions which run directly on your graph, Services run on resources managed by RoamJS. You could subscribe to each service individually to gain access to its functionality. To take advantage of RoamJS Services, make sure to sign up for an account [here](/signup).

If you are more technically minded and do not want to pay for a RoamJS Service, there will be tutorials for each service on how to use them on your self-hosted resources.
